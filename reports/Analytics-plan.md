## Analytics Plan

*Fill out this document before starting an analysis, and update periodically as and when circumstances change*
*This should serve as a useful clarity tool for you, the analyst, as well as someone not familiar with the work as a quickstart semantic guide*
*The aim of this document is to get you thinking about the whole data science process and help you to avoid some common pitfalls*
*The plan should be reviewed by another data-experienced peer following the initial completion and and subsequent updates*

### Research Question

*What are you trying to answer?*
*what is the objective of the analysis?*
*Why is it important?*

### Data

*What does the data describe? What are the variables?*
*What format is the data?*
*How will it be ingested into the pipeline?*
*How big/small is the dataset?*
*Are the classes balanced/imbalanced?*

### Exploration

*How will you explore the data?*
*What type of plots/analyses are most appropriate for this data?*
*Will you use any specific tools to explore the data?*

### Transformations/Feature Engineering

*What transformations are applied during in the pipeline?*
*Can you use a feature store or do you need to custom build your own features?*
*What features will you engineer and how do they relate to the raw data and ouput?*

### Modelling

*What modelling approach will you take? Why?*
*What package/s are you using for the modelling?*
*What assumptions does your modelling method/algorithm depend on?*
*Does your data/analysis meet the assumptions?*

### Evaluation

*How are you evaluating your model?*
*What metric will you use?*
*Is your metric appropriate? (considering the data, objective and class imbalance)*

### Reporting/visualisation

*How will you report this analysis - written tech report, journal paper, powerpoint pres, custom dashboard, proprietary dashboard etc.?*
*Who are the stakeholders that will be consuming this report, what method is most appropriate for the audience?*
*What tools will you use? (matplotlib, Dash, PowerBI etc)*

### Deployment

*Will this analysis be deployed in a production environment?* 
*Have you considered model monitoring, concept drift & MLOps?*
