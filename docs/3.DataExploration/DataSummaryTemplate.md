# Data Report Template

This file should be created for each dataset received or processed for the project. Please copy and rename the data report inline with the [data overview document](/docs/2.DataAcquisitionAndPreparation/Data%20Pipeline/DataOverview.md). Update the links in the data definition document from this template to the copied and completed files. 

## Summary statistics of the data

## Initial plots of the data

## Data quality summary

Use the 3 data quality metrics from ISO8000-8. Basically, is the data accessible by those who need it? Does the data read correctly into the relevant tools and maintain it's meaning? Does the data represent what it is supposed to?  

## What is(are) the target variable(s)? 

## What are the explanatory variables? 

## Do you need to screen the variables? If yes, detail it here. 
i.e. use some technique to choose a priority list for investigation?

## What can be seen from the summary statstics and figures? 
This will also help with interpretation after modelling? 

## Is further processing required? If yes, detail.
## Is modelling required? If yes, can any of the exploratory information be helpful?
