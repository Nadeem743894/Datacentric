# Folder for hosting project management documents and reports for a data-driven Project

This directory is provided to help in the scoping of a viable data-driven project as well as providing all the practical information to ensure a successful project. By filling in the documents given you will create a tailored DCM workflow for the project to follow throughout. 

These include:

* [Project scoping](/docs/0.ProjectManagement/ProjectScoping.md) document. Once the project is in delivery this document will provide you with a tailored DCM workflow.  
* Project management and planning documents, such as the [Project Plan](/docs/0.ProjectManagement/ProjectPlan.md).
* [Closure report](/docs/0.ProjectManagement/ClosureReport.md) at the conclusion of the project.

* The [system architecture](/docs/0.ProjectManagement/SystemArchitecture.docx). This document can be a figure or a diagram that describes the flow of data throughout the whole process under investigation, including all the tools and systems that have been used to collect, process, and analyse the data, the tools used to report the results and any tools used for deployment. This can be developed using an ontology if available.   

You should keep documents on Harbour - there are internal and external folders to allow this. 
* Project deliverables, documents and presentations prepared to share information about the project and any interesting figures that you would like to share should be kept as required on Harbour.
