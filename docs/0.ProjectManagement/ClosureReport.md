## Overview

What was the high-level result of the project? Is the [public description](/docs/1.BusinessCase/High-levelBusinessCase.md) still an accurate overview of the project?  

## The Business Case

Considering the more detailed project plan in the [project scoping](/docs/0.ProjectManagement/ProjectScoping.md) document and the [detailed business case](/docs/1.BusinessCase/DetailedBusinessCase.md) were the original objectives met and what solutions were provided? 

## Data Acquisition and Preparation

Was the relevant data found and collected? Ensure all details are available in the [data documents](/docs/2.DataAcquisitionAndPreparation/) and the links exist to the correct [data files](/data/) and [code](/code/notebooks/2.DataAcquisitionAndPreparation/).

## Data Exploration 

Do the relevant data sets have an [exploration summary report](/docs/3.DataExploration/)? Is all the [exploration code](/code/notebooks/3.DataExploration/) available?

## Feature Transformation

Are the features taken forward for modelling [well documented](/docs/4.FeatureTransformation/FeatureSummaryReport.md) and the [processing code](/code/notebooks/4.FeatureTransformation/) available? Can the final [feature set](/data/processed-gold/) be accessed? If more than one feature set exists, ensure the link to the correct modelling task is in place. 

## Model Building

Is the [modelling strategy](/docs/5.ModelBuilding/ModellingStrategy.md) an accurate description of how modelling was carried out? Do all models have a [summary report](/docs/5.ModelBuilding/Model/) and supporting [code](/code/notebooks/5.ModelBuilding/)? Are the [final model](/docs/5.ModelBuilding/Model/FinalModelReport.md) and it's results well documented?   

## Intepretation and Reporting 

Have the model results been interpreted and reported for the relevant audiences? Please provide links to the outputs. 

If the project resulted in actionable insights please complete this [document](/docs/6.InterpretationAndReporting/ActionsAndInsights.md).

Please complete the lessons learned in this [document](/docs/6.InterpretationAndReporting/LessonsLearned.md).

## Deployment and Maintenance

Is the solution to be deployed? Are the [MLOps](/docs/7.DeploymentAndMaintenance/DeploymentStrategy.md) well documented? 
How will the solution be [maintained](/docs/7.DeploymentAndMaintenance/MaintenanceStrategy.md)?
