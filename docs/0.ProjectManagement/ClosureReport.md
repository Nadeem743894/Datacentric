# Project closure form

Project status (*please delete as required*):
* Complete


For each status please complete the closure report. The aim of this report is to ensure all documentation, codes and data are accessible and linked such that all decisions and insights can be traced and analysis repeated if needed.

## Overview

 - What was the high-level result of the project? Is the [public description](/docs/1.BusinessCase/High-levelBusinessCase.md) still an accurate overview of the project?  


The AMRC North West have a Low Carbon Smart Building Demonstrator, which showcases the leading solutions that can be retrofitted to a facility to analyse energy usage and reduce their carbon footprint. The demonstrator has been designed alongside a roadmap assessment so that businesses at any level of maturity can be assessed against it and will support them in improving. The roadmap is designed in a way to support a business evolve to a sustainable facility, ensuring that cost implications are considered, aiming to improve the three Pâ€™s of sustainability in the process. Planet, People and Profit. Therefore, it is developed to align to the traditional business case methodology employed. Flight simulators are a significant improvement to live flights in terms of sustainability, but as the solution is electrified there remain opportunities to decarbonise through energy efficiency measures, renewable energy generation and battery / hydrogen storage. Gatwick are investigating the acquisition of airplane batteries, that are at the end of their usable life within aerospace. There is a request to evaluate the capability of using the batteries to support the building and develop the solution to a usable asset rather than waste product, this will be scoped as a separate work package and priced accordingly.

## The Business Case

 - Considering the more detailed project plan in the [project scoping](/docs/0.ProjectManagement/ProjectScoping.md) document and the [detailed business case](/docs/1.BusinessCase/DetailedBusinessCase.md) were the original objectives met and what solutions were provided? 

 All the objectives mentioned in the project scoping and detailed business plan are met and the technical report with results is provided to customer to analyse flight simulators and make the site more sustainability. 

## Data Acquisition and Preparation

 - Was the relevant data found and collected? Ensure all details are available in the [data documents](/docs/2.DataAcquisitionAndPreparation/) and the links exist to the correct [data files](/data/) and [code](/code/notebooks/2.DataAcquisitionAndPreparation/).

## Data Exploration 

 - Do the relevant data sets have an [exploration summary report](/docs/3.DataExploration/)? Is all the [exploration code](/code/notebooks/3.DataExploration/) available?

 Yes, the data for each entities were collected and analysed. The data exploration played a vital role in analysing the trends and daily routines of simulators. 

## Feature Transformation

 - Are the features taken forward for modelling [well documented](/docs/4.FeatureTransformation/FeatureSummaryReport.md) and the [processing code](/code/notebooks/4.FeatureTransformation/) available? 

 Not Applicable
  - Can the final [feature set](/data/processed-gold/) be accessed? If more than one feature set exists, ensure the link to the correct modelling task is in place. 

  Not Applicable

## Model Building

 - Is the [modelling strategy](/docs/5.ModelBuilding/ModellingStrategy.md) an accurate description of how modelling was carried out? 

 Not Applicable
 - Do all models have a [summary report](/docs/5.ModelBuilding/Model/) and supporting [code](/code/notebooks/5.ModelBuilding/)? Are the [final model](/docs/5.ModelBuilding/Model/FinalModelReport.md) and it's results well documented?  

 Not Applicable 

## Intepretation and Reporting 

 - Have the model results been interpreted and reported for the relevant audiences? Please provide links to the outputs. 

 The results from data exploration has been inerpreted and explained in technical report. The graphs are generated and are present in [Graphs](\docs\Guidance\All_Graphs_with_Code.ipynb)
 - If the project resulted in actionable insights please complete this [document](/docs/6.InterpretationAndReporting/ActionsAndInsights.md).
 - Please complete the lessons learned in this [document](/docs/6.InterpretationAndReporting/LessonsLearned.md).
 - Is the [system architecture](/docs/0.ProjectManagement/SystemArchitecture.docx) representative of the process investigated? 

## Deployment and Maintenance

 - Is the solution to be deployed? Are the [MLOps](/docs/7.DeploymentAndMaintenance/DeploymentStrategy.md) well documented? 
 - How will the solution be [maintained](/docs/7.DeploymentAndMaintenance/MaintenanceStrategy.md)?
