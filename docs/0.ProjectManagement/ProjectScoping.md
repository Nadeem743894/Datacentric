### Aim of the document

The aim of this document is to plan the technical aspects of a data project (including required resources) in the context of the business case and the planned end product. It is recommended that this document is filled in during project scoping (at this stage it may not be clear the project is viable or how much money/time/resource are required depending on data availability and storage options). The document is set out according to the AMRC Data-Centric Manufacturing Workflow and for viable projects will provide a strong foundation for producing a Statement of Work as well as a tailored DCM workflow for the project team to follow. This document is also inline with the TMG [pre-registration](https://amrcwikijs.shef.ac.uk/en/AMRC/TMG/Data_Centric_Manufacturing/Experimental_Planning/Preregistration) document and can be used to provide the information for the Lockdown and Readiness gates.  Each bullet point should be considered and basic details given at the scoping stage.

> The next steps will only be considered in brief detail for now in an effort to ensure the right tools and expertise and timings are in place once the project is in delivery. Further guidance and details can be found in the relevant docs sub-directory.

## Step 3: Data Exploration (EDA)

The aim of data exploration is three-fold: 1. To check that the file contains the data that you expect, 2. To check the quality of the data before committing to more comprehensive analysis and 3. to provide some basic information and visualisations to better understand the data. 

* Who will carry out the data exploration? Mohammad Nadeem Ahangar (Software Engineer)
* What tools will be used to explore the data? Jypter Notebook, python libraries (Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib etc )
  * Does this require a licence? No 
  * Does anyone require training? No 
  * Have you identified the training - what are the timings and costs? N/A
* Who will need to see the results of the data exploration? Both Boeing and AMRC Northwest
* How will EDA be presented? Using Presentaion and a technical Report


## Step 4: Feature Transformation

The aim of feature transformation is to ensure that only relevant bits of the data are used to build models and for further analysis. This may be annual averages, or principal components, or some other technique to reduce the amount of data whilst maintaining the relevant information.

* Who will carry out the feature engineering? Mohammad Nadeem Ahangar (Software Engineer)
* What tools will be used for feature transformation? Jypter Notebook, python libraries (Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib etc )
* Does anyone require training? NO
  * Have you identified the training - what are the timings and costs?

* How will EDA of the features be carried out? Using technical plots like heatmaps, 3D plotting etc
* Who will need to see the EDA of the features and how will it be presented to them?  AMRC Northwest and Boeing.

## Step 5: Model building  N/A 
## Note: In the project, several models were applied like K-Means and DBSCAN. The reason to apply these models were to find the clusters that can shown patterns snd help further for model deployment. As the patterns were not found in the data, the model training and deployment was not required. 







Here the word 'model' is representative of a statistical/machine learning or AI model. The aim of model building is to get further insights from the data and to understand the statistical significance of any identified patterns so far. 

* Will the models aim to describe what exists or predict? The modelling strategy will depend on this. 
* Who will carry out the model building?
* What tools will be required to carry out model building?
  * Are licences required? Give details if yes.
* What models do you expect to use? 
* Is training required? 
  * Have you identified training, what is the cost and timing of such training? 
* Can you estimate the computer power required?
  * Will you require high performance computing?
  * Will you require cloud access?
  * Do you have access to the correct resources?
    * If no, what are the estimated costs and timescales for the required access?
* Will data be created from the model building and analysis? 

## Step 6: Evaluation and reporting

To understand the insights and limitations of any data science work requires a collective of expertise and so time should be spent sharing and disseminating results to different stakeholders for feedback and discussion. 

* Who will be required to see the results of the analysis? 
  * How many different types of stakeholder are they and will they require different presentation methods? Only Boeing 
  * Do you need to write a report/give a presentation/etc?  Yes
  * Who will review outputs? Technical Lead (Zohaib)
* Do outputs need marketing input? NO
  * Can you give an idea of the costs/time required from the marketing team? N/A
* Do you have a plan/budget to publish the work if possible? N/A
* How will success be measured? From customer review and the overall objectives achieved

## Step 7: Deployment and maintenance N/A

For successful projects there may be a request for any software or model to become operational. This requires an understanding of MLOps and may involve the commercial team. There may be no answers to this section in the scoping but it may be considered later in the project, or even after the end.  

* Have you been made aware that this should produce operational software/models? 
  * Who will be responsible for the software/models?
  * Who will maintain the software/models? 
* Can the data/software/models be monetised?
  * If yes, give details.
