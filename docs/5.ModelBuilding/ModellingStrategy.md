# The modelling strategy

It is important to think carefully about the appropriate modelling technique and how it will be assessed for performance before completing any modelling, this is the modelling strategy. This document aims to give advice on what needs to be considered in the modelling strategy. This has already been given some thought in the project scoping but following data acquisition and exploration may need updating.  You can copy from the project scoping document if nothing has changed. Otherwise, the same questions are given below while the more detailed considerations are given in the specific model reports: 

> From project scoping document: 

Here the word 'model' is representative of a statistical/machine learning or AI model. The aim of model building is to get further insights from the data, to predict based on the current data, and to understand the statistical significance of any identified patterns or relationships. 

* Will the models aim to describe what exists or predict? The modelling strategy will depend on this. 
* Who will carry out the model building?
* What tools will be required to carry out model building?
  * Are licences required? Give details if yes.
* What models do you expect to use? 
* Is training required? 
  * Have you identified training, what is the cost and timing of such training? 
* Can you estimate the computer power required?
  * Will you require high performance computing?
  * Will you require cloud access?
  * Do you have access to the correct resources?
    * If no, what are the estimated costs and timescales for the required access?
* Will data be created from the model building and analysis? 


> More detailed modelling considerations are given in each model report:

- [The baseline model](/docs/5.ModelBuilding/Model/Baseline/Baseline%20Model.md).
- [Further models](/docs/5.ModelBuilding/Model/Model%201/ModelReport.md).  Edit this dependent on the number of models built.  
- [The final model](/docs/5.ModelBuilding/Model/FinalModelReport.md).
