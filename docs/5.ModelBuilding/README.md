### Modelling

*What modelling approach will you take? Why?*
*What package/s are you using for the modelling?*
*What assumptions does your modelling method/algorithm depend on?*
*Does your data/analysis meet the assumptions?*


### Evaluation

*How are you evaluating your model?*
*What metric will you use?*
*Is your metric appropriate? (considering the data, objective and class imbalance)*
