# Model Building 

This folder contains the documentation for models that have been built and stored in the [models](/models/) directory. There may be a need to build multiple models and tracking how they differ in terms of inputs/outputs/assumptions/metrics/etc is vital for interpretation and traceability of model results. Models will always be conditional on the data used and the assumptions made and these conditions must be made clear. Each model should be given its own folder for detailed documentation but a document of the [modelling strategy](/docs/5.ModelBuilding/ModellingStrategy.md) should be completed first.   

Before starting to build models you should re-address the questions in the project scoping given below and make sure all practical elements are in place. Now is also the time to think in a bit more detail about the modelling approach you will use, its assumptions and how it will be evaluated, this will be the [modelling strategy](/docs/5.ModelBuilding/ModellingStrategy.md).

> From project scoping document 

Here the word 'model' is representative of a statistical/machine learning or AI model. The aim of model building is to get further insights from the data and to understand the statistical significance of any identified patterns or relationships. 

* Who will carry out the model building?
* What tools will be required to carry out model building?
  * Are licences required? Give details if yes.
* What models do you expect to use? 
* Is training required? 
  * Have you identified training, what is the cost and timing of such training? 
* Can you estimate the computer power required?
  * Will you require high performance computing?
  * Will you require cloud access?
  * Do you have access to the correct resources?
    * If no, what are the estimated costs and timescales for the required access?
* Will data be created from the model building and analysis?
