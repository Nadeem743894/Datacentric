# Final Model Report

This report contains information on the final model that is used to provide insights in relation to the original objectives and aid business-related decision making. 

The final model can be found [here](/models/).

## Data preparation

* Do you have all the data required to complete the modelling exercise?
  * Have you kept a hold-out test set, give details. 

## Modelling assumptions

* What modelling technique is used? 
* What assumptions does the chosen modelling technique rely on? 
  * Are these assumptions met, please give details. 

## Model set-up

* What is the target output?
* What are the inputs?
* How will hyperparameters be tracked? 
* How has the final model been updated from the previous model? 

## Model evaluation
* How will the model be evaluated?  
  * Does the model have any standard metrics/plots that can help assess model fit and performance?
  * What metrics are appropriate? Consider the amount of data and particularly any imbalance as well as the modelling objectives. 
  * What metrics and plots have been produced and what do they say about model fit and performance? 
  * Is overfitting a problem? 

## Model interpretation
* Do model results make sense and can they be interpreted? 
  * Do you understand how the model has come to its results? 
* What visualisations can be used to help interpret the model results? 
* What insights can be gained from the model? 
* Are there any concerns about limitations to this modelling approach? If yes, give details. 

## Next step
* Move onto the [interpretation and reporting](/docs/6.InterpretationAndReporting/) if you are satisfied that the final model is sufficient to meet the original objectives.
