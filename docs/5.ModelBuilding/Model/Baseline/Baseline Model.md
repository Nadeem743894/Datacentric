# Baseline Model Report

The very initial/naive model to be trained and evaluated quickly after the appropriate feature set has been produced. The baseline model can be used to assess the feasibility of the modelling approach and to help interpret more comprehensive models. 

The baseline model can be found [here](/models/).

## Data preparation

* Do you have all the data required to complete the modelling exercise?
  * Have you kept a hold-out test set, give details. 

## Modelling assumptions

* What modelling technique is used? 
* What assumptions does the chosen modelling technique rely on? 
  * Are these assumptions met, please give details. 

## Model set-up

* What is the target output?
* What are the inputs?
* How will hyperparameters be tracked? 

## Model evaluation
* How will the model be evaluated?  
  * Does the model have any standard metrics/plots that can help assess model fit and performance?
  * What metrics are appropriate? Consider the amount of data and particularly any imbalance as well as the modelling objectives. 
  * What metrics and plots have been produced and what do they say about model fit and performance? 
  * Is overfitting a problem? 

## Model interpretation
* Do model results make sense and can they be interpreted? 
  * Do you understand how the model has come to its results? 
* What visualisations can be used to help interpret the model results? 
* What insights can be gained from the model? 
* Are there any concerns about limitations to this modelling approach? If yes, give details. 

## Next steps
* Will you build another model? If yes, provide the link to the [next report](/docs/5.ModelBuilding/Model/Model%201/ModelReport.md).
