# The data strategy

This document sets out your data strategy and should be carried out before any data is collected or analysed. Much of the data strategy can be taken from the [project scoping document](/docs/ProjectManagement/ProjectScoping.md), although it is likely to be a live document as the project progresses. The advantage of completing the data strategy here is that the data strategy will be version controlled and previous iterations are saved if decisions are reversed.
