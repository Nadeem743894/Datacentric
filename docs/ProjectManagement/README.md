# Folder for hosting project management documents and reports for a data-driven Project

This folder is provided to help in the scoping of a viable data-driven project as well as providing all the practical information to ensure a successful project. By filling in the documents given you will create a tailored DCM workflow for the project to follow throughout.

* Project management and planning documents, such as the [Project Plan](/docs/ProjectManagement/ProjectPlan.md)
* [Closure report](/docs/ProjectManagement/ClosureReport.md) at the conclusion of the project
