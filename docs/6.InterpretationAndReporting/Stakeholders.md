# Stakeholders and their reporting needs

This document allows you to document which stakeholders you need to report to and what outputs will provide the necessary reporting for each. 

| Stakeholder | Output requirement   | Headline result  | Link to output | 
| ---:| ---: | ---: | ---: | 
| Stakeholder 1 | Output 1 | Headline result 1 | [Stakeholder output 1](/link/to/output1)|
| Stakeholder n | Output n | Headline result n | [Stakeholder output n](/link/to/outputn)|

It is important to understand the audience for which outputs are being produced and what they need to know from the project.  Outputs may be presentations, final report, dashboard, etc. Headline results may be a specific result that can be actioned, or perhaps a new dashboard that can be monitored or a new dataset.  The link may be internal in the Github directory, to Harbour or to some public domain containing the output.
