# Folder to describe the data pipeline, where the data is kept and how it is processed. 

This folder contains two documents: 

1. The [data definition](/docs/2.DataAcquisitionAndPreparation/Data%20Pipeline/DataDefinition.md) documents each of the data sets and providing links to where they are and codes used to load and process it. 

2. The [data pipeline](/docs/2.DataAcquisitionAndPreparation/Data%20Pipeline/DataPipeline.txt) provides a visual representation of the data pipeline.
