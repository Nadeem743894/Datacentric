# The data strategy

This document sets out your data strategy and should be carried out before any data is collected or analysed. The first draft of the data strategy can be copied from the [project scoping document](/docs/ProjectManagement/ProjectScoping.md). This, however, should be a live document and maintained and updated as the project progresses.
