## Documentation of the experimental design. 

Experimental design is a key step for machining projects but is also required in many other projects, especially when data collection is limited by costs and resource availability. Creating the experimental design is part of the mandatory *Readiness Gate* for TMG projects and should address the questions given [here](https://amrcwikijs.shef.ac.uk/en/AMRC/TMG/Data_Centric_Manufacturing/Experimental_Planning/Design_of_Experiments) and below. The answers to these questions should provide the basis for choosing the best experimental design for your needs. 

#### TMG Design of experiment checklist
What are the objectives of the experiment?
Do we want to identify a relationship between a response and a small number of factors (regression modelling)?
Do we want to find the most important factors from a long list of possible factors (screening design)?
Do we want to maximise/minimise a response for a number of factors (response surface methodology)?
What levels of each factor should we use in the first-stage? Do we expect any higher-order interaction?
What size effect do we expect to see for a given factor? This will help us decide how many replicates we need.
Are there any so-called “nuisance factors” that may affect the response variable? If so, is it possible to use a blocked design?
Are there any restrictions on run order that mean we cannot fully randomise the design?


### Additional checklist
Are there resource limitations that need to be taken into account? 
Where is the stopping point to check the experiment is running correctly? 


More general information on experimental design and further guidance on the above questions is given [here](https://amrcwikijs.shef.ac.uk/en/AMRCDS/Guidance/DataAcquisitionandPreparation/DesignOfExperiments).
