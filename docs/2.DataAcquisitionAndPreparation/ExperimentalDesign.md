## Documentation of the experimental design. 

1. Objectives of the Experiment:

    * Identify Relationships: The goal is to identify relationships between energy usage and various factors like temperature, light levels, and equipment power consumption in flight simulation centers.
    * Screening Design: This setup will be used to determine which factors (e.g., power, temperature) significantly influence energy efficiency.
2. Factors and Levels:

     * Factors: Current, temperature, light intensity, equipment runtime.
     * Levels: Different values for temperature and lighting, varying power consumption levels of simulation equipment.
     * Higher-Order Interaction: Anticipated between energy consumption and environmental factors (temperature and light).
3. Size Effect and Replicates:

     * The effect size is expected to be noticeable across different energy consumption patterns, requiring continuous monitoring with replicates to capture variability.
4. Nuisance Factors and Blocked Design:

    * External factors like facility usage schedules or maintenance might affect data consistency. A blocked design could be implemented to control for these nuisance factors.
5. Randomization and Run Order:

    * Due to practical constraints (e.g., set times for simulations), full randomization may not be possible. Data collection will be conducted in a semi-controlled manner.
## Additional Checklist
1.  Resource Limitations:

    * Cost and resource availability for data sensors and personnel limit the scope. Monitoring will be conducted over an 8-week period, focusing on non-invasive methods.
2. Stopping Point for Validation:

    *Initial data collection will be reviewed weekly to ensure sensor accuracy and experiment correctness. If anomalies arise, adjustments will be made to the methodology.
