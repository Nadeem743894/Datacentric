# A folder to keep all documents related to the acquisition and preparation of data to be used in the project.

This includes: 

* The [data strategy](/docs/2.DataAcquisitionAndPreparation/DataStrategy.md). This is a written document and should initially keep a copy of the details of the data from the scoping document but will be maintained and updated as the project progresses. In its final form it should allow other users to see exactly what data was used where and why, how it was acquired and where from, and how it was processed and by who. The data strategy should be considered a live document and regularly reviewed.
