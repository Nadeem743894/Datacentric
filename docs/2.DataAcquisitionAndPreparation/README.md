# A folder to keep all documents related to the acquisition and preparation of data to be used in the project.

In this folder you will find all the documents related to the acquisition and processing of data


This includes: 

* The [data strategy](/docs/2.DataAcquisitionAndPreparation/DataStrategy.md). This is a written document and should initially keep a copy of the details of the data from the scoping document but will be maintained and updated as the project progresses. In its final form it should allow other users to see exactly what data was used where and why, how it was acquired and where from, and how it was processed and by who. The data strategy should be considered a live document and regularly reviewed. The data strategy should also include information on data created from the project, including how it can be used and accessed. It will act as your data management plan. 

* A visual representation of the [data pipeline](/docs/2.DataAcquisitionAndPreparation/Data%20Flow/DataPipeline.txt). We recommend following the medallion architecture as used in [Databricks](https://www.databricks.com/glossary/medallion-architecture).  
* A text [description](/docs/2.DataAcquisitionAndPreparation/Data%20Pipeline/DataDefintion.md) containing links and details of the data pipeline. 

* A [data dictionary](/docs/2.DataAcquisitionAndPreparation/Data%20Dictionaries/) for each database created.

The impacts of limitations in data acquisition is given [here](/docs/Guidance/MissingData.md).
