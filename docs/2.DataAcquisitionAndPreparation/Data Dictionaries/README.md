# Data Dictionaries

The data dictionaries describe the contents of a data set, usually with an Excel sheet or with details on a data schema (for database management systems). It may also take the form of a data ontology. There should be a data dictionary for each different data set or database but may contain links between them.

In most cases, it is expected that the data dictionary will be an Excel sheet. It may be supplied by our partners, or created with the partners when data is acquired or created as part of the project. 

The data dictionary should contain a description of each column (data stream) in the dataset (database), including what the data stream is, a short description, type of data, some key values such as minimum or maximum. Any information that is required to understand the data set should be included while remaining concise. 

If a database is being used the schema can be described here or in a separate document with a link. If an ontology is being used you should link to it here. 

The data dictionary can help to define a common data language for any data created and a translator for analysis when different data sources have different variable names. It will also provide information on any transformations that are necessary when data is provided in different units.
