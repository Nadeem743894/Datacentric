# Feature transformation reports.

In this folder you will keep a report of the features used to perform analysis in Step 5, showing how they relate to the original business case:

[Feature Summary Report](/docs/4.FeatureTransformation/FeatureSummaryReport.md)

The feature store should be kept in the [gold data folder](/data/processed-gold/).

The details of the feature datasets and their processing should be kept in [Data overview](/docs/2.DataAcquisitionAndPreparation/Data%20Pipeline/DataOverview.md). This file contains links to the codes used and access requirements, as well as links to the original data and the feature data.
