## Feature Summary Report

 - What are the features being created? 

Here you can list the features that have been created or [link to data dictionary](/link/to/file)

 - How will these features help to meet the business objective?

 Either write an explanation here or link to a [data summary report](/docs/3.DataExploration/DataSummaryTemplate.md) with the relevant information. 

 - Are there any limitations or compromises made in the creation of suitable features? Does this have any impact on the business objectives? 
 
 *Any analysis involving the feature selection will be dependent on those features so acknowledging any limitations is important. This doesn't necessarily mean they are not sufficient for the current scope but they may be insufficient if the scope of the project changes.*
