# The maintenance strategy

The aim of this document is to ensure that any deployed solutions are suitably maintained throughout their lifetime.

* Who will be responsible for maintaining the solution? 
* Who will be responsible for providing de-bugging services? 
* How often will the solution be assessed in deployment? 
* How will model drift and concept drift be assessed and dealt with? 
* How will the solution be continuously monitored as fit-for-purpose? 
* What will happen if the solution is identified as no longer fit-for-purpose? 

**Further guidance on MLOps is available here: https://amrcwikijs.shef.ac.uk/en/AMRCDS/Guidance/DeploymentAndMaintenance**
