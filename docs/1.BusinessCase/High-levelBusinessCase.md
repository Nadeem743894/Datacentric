## Project Title: Assessing the Energy Usage of Boeing's Flight Simulation Centers

# Objective: 
The primary goal of this project is to analyse and enhance the energy efficiency of Boeing's flight simulation centers as part of Gatwick's broader decarbonisation strategy. By leveraging advanced technologies and data analytics, the project aims to reduce the carbon footprint of these facilities and support their transition towards net-zero operations.

# Public Description:

As part of its commitment to environmental sustainability, Gatwick Airport is focusing on reducing the carbon footprint of its flight simulation centers. These centers play a crucial role in aviation training, offering a digital alternative to live flight training and significantly contributing to decarbonisation. However, there is still potential to further reduce their environmental impact.

This project, conducted in collaboration with Boeing and Gatwick, involves a comprehensive analysis of energy consumption within the flight simulation centers. By installing state-of-the-art sensors and utilising advanced data analytics, the project will provide insights into current energy usage patterns and identify opportunities for improvement. The ultimate aim is to develop and implement strategies that enhance energy efficiency, integrate renewable energy solutions, and adopt innovative technologies.

The project will also explore the potential of repurposing end-of-life aerospace batteries to support the facility's energy needs, contributing to a circular economy approach. The findings and recommendations from this project will support Boeing's and Gatwick's goals of achieving net-zero emissions and advancing sustainable practices in aviation training.

This high-level overview outlines the project's objectives to drive significant environmental benefits and operational efficiencies, aligning with the broader sustainability goals of the aviation industry.
