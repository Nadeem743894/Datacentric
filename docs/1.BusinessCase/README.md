# Folder for hosting documents related to the business case of a data-driven Project

Understanding the business need is vital for the success of any data-driven project and these documents ensure that this is well stated at the start of the project. They will provide all the necessary details to help the PM draft the SoW and will provide the basis of any reports or outputs that are required. They also provide the relevant information for those not initially involved in the project to quickly acquaint themselves with the motivation and requirements of the project. 

These include:

* A [document](/docs/1.BusinessCase/High-levelBusinessCase.md) containing the high-level business case suitable for a public description.
* A [document](/docs/1.BusinessCase/DetailedBusinessCase.md) containing a more detailed insight to the business case. This document will help to prepare the SoW and provide a good foundation for an introduction to any report. 


Please keep any documented evidence on the project Sharepoint.
A [folder](/link/to/sharepoint/) to gather information obtained from project partners and evidence related to the project.
