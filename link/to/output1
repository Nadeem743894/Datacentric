The stakeholders involved in the project have varying reporting needs based on their roles. 

The Project Manager requires weekly progress reports to stay informed about sensor data trends and key project milestones. For the Technical Team, a data anlysis is essential to analyze the simulator's current consumption and detect any anomalies as they occur. AMRC Leadership will receive a final project report summarizing energy efficiency improvements and insights gained from the data analysis, while the Partners will be provided with monthly summary reports detailing simulator energy usage and any maintenance alerts.  Lastly, the Operations Team will receive immediate alerts and notifications if the system breaches any predefined current thresholds or encounters operational failures, ensuring quick response to issues. All these outputs will be shared through internal directories and alert systems based on the needs of each stakeholder.
